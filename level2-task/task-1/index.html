                        <h2>biography</h2>
                        <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, India, was a visionary
                            scientist, engineer, and
                            statesman. Fondly known as the "Missile Man of India," he played a pivotal role in
                            India's space and defense programs.
                            Dr. Kalam's exceptional leadership led to the development of India's indigenous
                            satellite launch vehicle, SLV-3, and
                            various successful missile projects like Agni and Prithvi.</p>
                        <p>His contributions to science and technology earned him numerous accolades, including the
                            prestigious Bharat Ratna,
                            India's highest civilian award. Beyond his scientific achievements, he served as the
                            11th President of India from 2002
                            to 2007, during which he focused on inspiring the youth and promoting education. Dr.
                            Abdul Kalam's humility, wisdom, and
                            dedication to the progress of the nation continue to inspire millions worldwide. He
                            passed away on July 27, 2015, but
                            his legacy as a beloved leader and role model lives on.
